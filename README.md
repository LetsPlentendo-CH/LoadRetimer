# LoadRetimer

## About
This is a tool I made for the NSMBW speedrunning community. It allows you to easily retime a video of a run without loads (removing all the black frames from loading segments).
The names for Any% loads are hardcoded into the program, but you can switch to manually enter the name of every load if you wish to retime a different category (or even a different game for that matter!)

## .lds files
Load files are stored in a compact, custom format. If you want to view a load file as text, you can upload a .lds file to [this](https://rootcubed.dev/ldsviewer/) site and look at the loads that way.
